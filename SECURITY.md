❌ Currently Scrimmie! 6v6 has not been updated for Season 10/11, which will come at a later date. Due to the April Fools bug, this may impact your experience with it until the code is updated.

⚠️ The Development builds will be published for testing if you wish, **however you may encounter bugs while using them**. They are also **NOT COMPLETED** and *are for those who wish to try new versions before they release*

🔄 6v6 Support is being introduced into the standard Scrimmie! preset with v4.0. Join the Discord or follow me on Twitter @cbfow for the latest updates.
**This will NOT include the OW1 version of Scrimmie! 6v6, which will remain its own separate version.**
