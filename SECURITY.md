| **5v5 Standard** | 3.6.5   | Y2TXE | :white_check_mark: |
| 5v5 Professional | 3.6.5   | A8XVJ | :white_check_mark: |

| Development | v4.0 | EE0X8 | ⚠️ |

⚠️ The Develoment Version **recieves updates quicker, but is less stable than the Live version**
  - Currently **v4.0 has some issues with Player Status triggering,** which I am currently looking into. It **does not** affect gameplay

🔄 6v6 Support is being introduced into the standard Scrimmie! preset with v4.0. Join the Discord or follow me on Twitter @cbfow for the latest updates.
**This will NOT include the OW1 version of Scrimmie! 6v6, which will remain its own separate version.**
